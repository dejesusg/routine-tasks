# Run Routine Tasks on a newly deployed LOCAL Device:

* Change Device Name (TODO: and then Add it to AD)
* Set Power Settings (If Device is a Notebook/Tablet)
  * Power Button Behavior, Lid Close Behavior, Display Idle Behavior, etc.

TODO:

* Add Conditional Checking Prior to Each Step in the Chain
* Force Group Policy Updates
* Enumerate current devices that RegEx match Building Name and Room Number in order to Automate assignment of "DeviceNumber" variable.
* Get Device Manufacturer Information, and Add it to the devices description in AD (e.g. "Dell Inspiron 420")
